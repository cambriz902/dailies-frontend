# dailies-frontend

UI to allow a user to create, view, delete Categories and Dailies for each category.

It will allow them to mark dailies as completed for each day and will award a point for the Category
associated with that Daily. 

The user can then view how they are performing in each category(ex: "Health", "Software Development", "Relationship")
and if they are completing the dailies they have created for them.

This UI will sent request to an external API i'm creating.
